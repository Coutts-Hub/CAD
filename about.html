            <td>In my last role of 10yrs I was responsible for checking the design by Virtual CAD (Siemens - VisMockup). This included on occasion some	design changes to meet Safety Data Sheet Requirements in relation to routing & packaging.  This included static & dynamic measurements for specified clearance with respect to e.g. sharp edges, abrasion & motion with a generated field (DIAS Balloon) and specific movement of the harness and opposing part(s). This was also at times with respect to manufacturing and the assembly process. These issues were tracked in a database (E2Ks) and recorded for tracking and legal purposes. If & when the situation arose I would update the CAD Design to accomodate the requirements if the designated designer wasn't able to.	
<p>
I also attended regular design reviews to discuss and brain storm resolutions to issues which included all stakeholders & program management teams since the harnesses run throughout the vehicle.
</p>

<p>
I have a robust background in engineering, project management, construction and data coordination & manipulation and the design process, combined with strong proficiency metrics reporting, tracking and excellent communication skills. In my previous roles, I have demonstrated strong attention to detail and excellent organisational skills. I am proficient in all Microsoft Office applications particularly Excel which has been essential for effective project management and metrics reporting including to senior management.</p>

I possess an analytical thought process and a logical approach to problem-solving, which has been key to my success in previous roles. My proactive approach and ability to work independently as well as part of a team have allowed me to excel in similar environments.

<td>Throughout my career, I have developed a comprehensive skill set that includes the use of tools such as Teamcenter Eng. database, Catia V5, and Vis Mockup. My experience in CAD releasing and coordination, data translation, and problem-solving which has equipped me with the technical acumen necessary for various roles and I am hoping to expand this by transitioning to Solidworks for future roles. I have successfully managed engineering projects from initial design through change management to final product release, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in all processes. As a qualified photographer I also have experience in Adobe Photoshop & Lightroom and on a personal level obviously some experience of web design and I have previously managed a sharepoint site for a third party company.
