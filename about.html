              <p>In my last role of 10 years, I was responsible for checking the design by Virtual CAD (Siemens - VisMockup). This included occasional design changes to meet Safety Data Sheet requirements in relation to routing and packaging. This involved static & dynamic measurements for specified clearances, e.g. sharp edges, abrasion, and motion with generated fields (DIAS Balloon) and harness movement. These issues were tracked in a database (E2Ks) and recorded for traceability. I would also update the CAD design as needed.</p>
              <p>I attended regular design reviews with stakeholders and program teams to resolve design issues for vehicle harnesses.</p>
              <p>My background includes engineering, project management, construction, data coordination and communication. I'm proficient in Excel for metrics, reporting, and project tracking.</p>
              <p>I approach problems analytically and logically, and work well independently or in teams.</p>

              <p>I've developed skills using Teamcenter Eng., Catia V5, Vis Mockup, and am expanding into Solidworks. My experience includes CAD releasing, data translation, problem-solving, and managing engineering projects through to release.</p>
              <p>As a qualified photographer, I also use Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, and have managed a SharePoint site and basic web design.</p>
